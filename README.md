# ThirdEyeForBlind
  The "Third Eye for Blind" is a device created to assist the blind to compensate for their lack of vision by employing their other senses, such as   touch and sound. It combines audio and vibration signals to alert the user of an impending obstacle. The frequency of the sound and vibration messages rises as the   distance between the glove and the obstruction decreases. Thus, the technology aids in making navigating easier for those in need.
# Update 
  Now it is equipped with a alert system. If any mishappening occurs to the person, it will alert their close once. Also, they can monitor movements on the Thingspeak   cloud.

# Future Scope
We can make several improvements to this module to improve its throughput. This prototype can be used in factories on vehicles that carry large shipments. Other uses include self-driving cars and vehicles operating in airports to prevent accidents. This can also help Blind people by equipping walking sticks with sensors to increase their efficiency. We can make this prototype a jacket that a blind person can wear and avoid obstacles. This jacket will include a vibration motor to give better feedback. Also, we can attach a GSM module and Force sensor to send messages to family members in case of an accident.
